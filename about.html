                                            I began working part-time during the summer of July. I mainly helped with big projects, and some day-to-day operations.

                                            Over the first fall and winter of working, I began to work full-time harvesting as well as moving, loading, and shipping pigs.

                                            I was a part of the scouting program all throughout my youth. In June of 2017 I earned the rank of Eagle Scout and became the Senior Patrol Leader

                                            I helped several members of the troop to achieve their rank of Eagle Scout, and led them at camps and klondikes.

                                            Because the younger men earned their rank of Eagle Scout, I was retired after a little over a year so they could gain their experience leading.

                                            I served a full-time proselyting mission which means that I spent one hundred percent of my time serving and teaching those in the Philadelphia area.
