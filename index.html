                                        Over two thousand tornadoes occur worldwide each year, with the majority of these tornadoes occurring in the United States, which means  that 3 out of 4 tornadoes occur in the United States.

                                        The term tornado alley refers to an area or region that has a high occurrence of tornadoes.

                                        The tornado scale used to measure tornadoes in the U.S. is the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which replaced the original Fujita Scale in 2007.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        About 80% of all tornadoes that occur in the United States are EF0 and EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, less than 1% of all tornadoes in the United States are in the violent EF4 or EF5 category.
                                    </li>

                                        The most recording breaking tornado in history was the Tri-State Tornado. It traveled for 235 miles and lasted for over 3 hours before dissipating, with winds reaching near 300 miles per hour.
                                    </li>

                                        Tornado warnings have a 70% false alarm rate.

                                        The British were driven out of Washington D.C. on August 25th, 1814 due to a tornado. This was likely what prevented the British from doing any more damage to Washington DC. The day before the tornado struck, the British burned the White House and a large part of the city.

                                        While a tornado can occur at any time they most frequently occur between 3:00pm and 9:00pm.

                                        During the Dixie Tornado outbreak a home was completely destroyed in Columbiana, but a kitchen cabinet that was in the home remained standing upright and had 36 unbroken eggs on top of it.

                                        The largest tornado outbreak was in 2011 on April 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th. The National Weather Service reported a total of 355 tornadoes during this 4-day timespan.
